## Characters & Droids

These are characters and Droids from the movies. The characters are more of a stretch than the Droids to consider for a UCS collection. The 7194 Yoda set, similar to the Darth Maul bust (set 10018) are very brick-built. Other UCS models in contrast are much more complex to build. I therefor do not consider them as a must-have for UCS collections, but this is highly subjective. The newer characters in Porg, Yoda (75255) and The Child (Baby Yoda) and Chewbacca are debatable, since they are much more detailed and less bricky builds. As for the Droids, including the 10186 General Grievous, these are much more complex and fun to build, so I'll gladly collect them for their separate section in a UCS collection. Note that the 75306 Imperial Probe Droid was released in the Helmets line in wave 2 (see next section).

## Helmets & Busts

This line, apart from the early Darth Maul and promotional sets, are much easier and budget-friendlier to collect, at least if you started in 2020. They are much easier to display and transport. The sets are released in yearly waves of 3 sets each, with wave 2 containing the 75306 Imperial Probe Droid listed under Characters & Droids.

## Movie Diorama's

This line started with special promotional sets. The Micro Scale sets have several diorama-like sets as well, which seem to have evolved into the line of movie-scene dioramas with but was expanded to a line of black-base movie dioramas, each with a movie-quote tile characterised by the scene.

## Micro Scale sets

Almost all of these sets are Gift With Purchase sets, except for the Nebulon-B Frigate which was intended as an SDCC exclusive in 2020 and the Executor Super Star Destroyer. The 75356 SSD might start a new micro-scale UCS line if possible.

## Modular Figures

These Bionicle-style buildable figures are hardly as popular as the Bionicle sets themselves. But their collectability is much more accessible than $200+ UCS sets.
